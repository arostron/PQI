Pavement Quality Index project - for keeping track of which pavement is nice to longboard on

## The goal
I want to be able to keep track of the pavement quality in Edmonton, ie, which paths are smooth and better to longboard on.

## The plan
I've worked with the Strava API before to overlay all the rides ive done onto a single map of Edmonton or Calgary. I'd like to add pavement quality to that overlay map so I can tell which pavement is good pavement. The initial plan is to strap some vibration sensors or accelerometers to a microprocessor then stitch that data to the strava routes.
